# Houdini Python Projects
This is a collection of tools and scripts to enhance the Houdini workflow.
Below is a brief overview of the projects.

### Projects
- Assigning Materials Shelf Tool: This tool allows you to assign materials quicker. It can be pasted into a new tool on the toolbar.

- Basic Shelf Tool for Node Setup: A simple example of a shelf tool for setting up garment geo nodes. This can be customized to fit individual setups, providing a starting point for node configurations for garment objects.

- FBX Export Tool: This tool is for exporting FBX files, such as fractured models for Unreal Engine 5. It ensures that the chunks do not get combined into a single mesh, keeping all pieces separated.

- Window for Assigning Materials (work in progress): I am currently working on a window for the assign materials functionality, which will further simplify the material assignment process.

#### Additional Resources
There are also some notes from a Python in Houdini course I completed in the notes.md file.
